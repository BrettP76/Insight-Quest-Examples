<#
This script retrieves the datasets, reports, and dashboards for a Power BI Premium capacity. 
The aggregate counts of these artifacts and the individual details of each artifact can be viewed within the PowerShell terminal
or optionally exported to CSV files.

#1. Authenticate to Power BI Service with Power BI Service Administrator credential

$User = "488545@mgmresorts.com"

Connect-PowerBIServiceAccount -Credential $myCred

#2. Provide the name of the premium capacity and capture the current date

$CapacityName = "Finance P1"

$RetrieveDate = Get-Date

#3. Retrieve the ID of a premium capacity into a variable based on the name of a workspace which is hosted on the premium capacity

#4. Retrieve the active app workspaces for the premium capacity identified in step #3.

$CapacityWorkspaces = Get-PowerBIWorkspace -Scope Organization -All | Where {$_.CapacityId -eq $CapacityId -and $_.State -eq "Active"}

#5. Retrieve the dashboards, reports, and datasets contained within the app workspaces of the premium capacity identified in step #4.
